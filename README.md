# Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms on the Cleveland heart disease dataset. The goal is to classify whether a patient has heart disease based on health-related features.


## Algorithms Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Stacking Ensemble technique combining multiple models with a meta-classifier)

## Results
Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Detailed results are available in the notebook.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies by installing the requirements
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/linhlinhle997/heart-disease-prediction.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
